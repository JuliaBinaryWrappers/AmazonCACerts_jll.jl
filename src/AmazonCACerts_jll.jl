    # this JLL package in their Project.toml) but engage in heroic hacks to do
    # something other than actually use a JLL package on 1.0-1.2.  By allowing
    # this package to be installed (but not loaded) on 1.0-1.2, we enable users
    # to avoid splitting their package versions into pre-1.3 and post-1.3 branches
    # if they are willing to engage in the kinds of hoop-jumping they might need
    # to in order to install binaries in a JLL-compatible way on 1.0-1.2. One
    # example of this hoop-jumping being to express a dependency on this JLL
    # package, then import it within a `VERSION >= v"1.3"` conditional, and use
    # the deprecated `build.jl` mechanism to download the binaries through e.g.
    # `BinaryProvider.jl`.  This should work well for the simplest packages, and
    # require greater and greater heroics for more and more complex packages.
